Beam Design Analysis Tool
This Python tool assists in the design and analysis of beams under various loads and conditions. It calculates key structural parameters such as the bending moment, shear forces, deflection, and resistance checks to ensure the beam meets safety and serviceability requirements.

Users can input beam properties, applied loads, and material strengths. The tool computes the load combination for the Ultimate Limit State (ULS), maximum bending moment, shear forces, and checks the sectionâ€™s resistance against shear and bending. Additionally, it calculates the vertical deflection to verify serviceability limits.

To use the tool, clone the repository and run the script. The program prompts for necessary inputs, performs calculations, and outputs results indicating whether the beam meets design requirements or requires adjustments.
